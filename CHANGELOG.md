## [v1.0.0] - First Stable Release

### âœ¨ What's Included

This is the first stable release of a modular and educational blockchain built in Java.

It includes all the core functionality required to simulate a minimal blockchain system:

### âœ… Core Features

- Basic `Block` structure with `previousHash`, `nonce`, `timestamp`, `transactions`
- Blockchain class with validation logic (`isValidLinkToChain`)
- Cryptographically signed transactions (ECDSA) with verification
- Mining logic with adjustable difficulty
- User key generation using elliptic curve (`secp256r1`)
- Clean output via `DisplayUtils` and structured logs via `LoggerUtils`
- Organized codebase with clear package separation (`core`, `util`, `app`)
- Prepared for JSON-based storage (coming in next version)

### ðŸ“¦ Directory Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/         # Entry point (Main)
â”œâ”€â”€ core/        # Block, Blockchain, Transaction, User
â””â”€â”€ util/        # LoggerUtils, DisplayUtils, CryptoUtils, etc.
```

### ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open in IntelliJ or your Java IDE
3. Run `Main.java` to simulate a blockchain session

### ðŸ”œ Coming Next

- Persistent blockchain storage using JSON
- Transaction pool refinement
- CLI or interactive GUI
- Multi-node or networking simulation
